Intro
=====

The ``Pulsesync FPGA`` project, is the implementation of a new TX driver system that interfaces with existing TS and TC machines and new developed DCDC module that drives the energy on the transmitter loop. The pulsesync is ment to receive configuration information from the TC on how to drive the energy onto the transmitter loop, while synchronizing the operation towards the TS by receiving a sync signal from it, and lock in on this signal. The main focus on the FPGA implementation is to implement the driver circuit for a gate driver, that will drive the energy onto the transmitter loop. A memory interface will be implemented for transferring configuration from the TC into the programmable region for controlling the operation of the gate driver, and allow to read out status of the ongoing operation of the system. The platform chosen for the operation is a Zynq-7 platform from XIlins, which incorporates a re-programmable logic region and a dedicated processing unit. The processing unit is used for high level access with the TC, and receive configuration etc. and providing status feedback from ongoing operation and allowing for starting, stopping and resetting operation. The implementation of the high level software package is not part of this project, and will not be described within this documentation in great detail.
